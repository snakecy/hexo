## Datasets Examples for machine learning

Here are the data sets from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) once I sorted and practiced. Some of the abstracts I summarized updated to my github [CUIMachineLearningRepository](https://github.com/snakecy/CUIMachineLearningRepositry).

Example:

### Image Segmentation

1. Data set website
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Image+Segmentation
2. Datasets describe
【1】The data used in our experiments were collected by Vision Group, University of Massachusetts.【2】We used to classify the image.【3】The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The images were hand segmented to create a classification for every pixel. Each instance is a 3x3 region. Number of Attributes has 19 continuous attributes, each attribute can describes as region-centroid-col、region-centroid-row、region-pixel-count、short-line-density-5、short-line-density-2、 vedge-mean、vegde-sd、hedge-mean、hedge-sd、intensity-mean、rawred-mean、rawblue-mean、rawgreen-mean、exred-mean、exblue-mean、exgreen-mean、value-mean、saturatoin-mean、hue-mean.【4】The database has 2310 samples, respectively belong to training with 210 samples and testing with 2100 samples. The categories of network system include seven categories, as shown in Table 1.

##### Table 1 Category Distribution of Network System

| Invasion | Training | Testing | Total Number of Samples |
| :------- | :------- | :------ | :------------ |
| Brickface | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| sky | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| Foliage | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| Cement | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| window | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| Path | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| grass | 30 | 300 | 330 |
| Total number of samples in total | 210 | 2100 | 2310 |
